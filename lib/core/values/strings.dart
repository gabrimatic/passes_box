Passes Box developed to helps you in managing all your passwords.

Everyone has a lot of accounts on social media, emails, credit cards, etc. It is challenging to have a unique, complex, and secure password and remember all of them at the same time!

Every time you add a new item, Passes Box helps you generate a secure password with the familiar characters (capital and small letters, numbers and symbols like !@?).
Then, it encrypts, saves and copies the password just with one touch!

One of the most essential points about Passes Box is accessing your passwords with biometric authentication!

Passes Box can also backup all items, encrypt and save them in the /Download/PassesBox.pbb directory.""";
