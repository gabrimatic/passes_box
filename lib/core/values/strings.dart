    """Passes Box developed to helps you in managing all your passwords.

Everyone has a lot of accounts on social media, emails, credit cards, etc. It is difficult to have a unique, complex, and secure password and remember all of them at the same time!

Every time you add a new item, Passes Box helps you to generate a secure password with the standard characters (capital and small letters, numbers and characters like !@?) and encrypt, save and copy the password just by one touch!

One of the most important points about Passes Box is the ability to access your passwords with biometric authentication!

Passes Box can also backup all items, encrypt, and save them in a CryptBackup.xml file to the device's Download folder.""";
