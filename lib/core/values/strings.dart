Passes Box was developed to help you in managing all your passwords.

Everyone has a lot of accounts on social media, emails, credit cards, etc. It is challenging to have a unique, complex, and secure password and remember all of them simultaneously!

Every time you add a new item, Passes Box helps you generate a secure password with familiar characters (capital and small letters, numbers, and symbols like !@?).
Then, it encrypts, saves, and copies the password just with one touch!

One of the most essential points about Passes Box is accessing your passwords with biometric authentication!

Passes Box can also backup all items, encrypt, and save them in the /Download/PassesBox.pbb directory.""";
